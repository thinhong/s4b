## Q-Q plot

Quantile-quantile plot (or Q-Q plot) is used to compare the shapes of distributions. A Q-Q plot has 2 axes: one is the quantile of our data, one is the quantile of a distribution. Very simple, if the quantile of our data align well with the quantile of that distribution, then we can say our data follow that distribution.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(7)
n_points <- 50 # sample size

df <- data.frame(y = rchisq(n_points, df = 3))

ggplot(df, aes(sample = y)) +
  stat_qq(distribution = qchisq, dparams = list(300, 3)) +
  stat_qq_line(distribution = qchisq, dparams = list(ncol(df), 3))

```
