Likelihood

The likelihood $\mathcal{L}(\theta \mid x)$ measures how well a model $\theta$ explains observed data $x$. It is defined as the probability of obtaining $x$ given the model $\theta$ [@fisher1922].

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta \mid x) = P(X = x \mid \theta)
$$

You are a detective. You walk into the scene and discover some clues $x$: footprints, a broken window, a half-eaten donut... For each suspect $\theta$, you ask:

"If this person $\theta$ did it, what's the chance they'd leave exactly these clues $x$?"

That chance is the likelihood $\mathcal{L}(\theta \mid x)$. The suspect with the highest $\mathcal{L}(\theta \mid x)$ is your prime suspect.

Quantile: quantiles are the lines that divide data into equally sized groups. Percentiles are quantiles that divide the data into 100 equally sized groups

The median is the 0.5 quantile or the 50th percentile.

-   There is a difference between how the word quantile of defined and how it is used in practice
-   There are many different ways to compute quantiles (the quantile function in R has 9 different methods)

To get the quantile of data, use `quantile()` function.
